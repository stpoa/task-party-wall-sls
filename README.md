## Task
Backend Coding Challenge

In the coding challenge, you will write an application called PartyWall.

Party Wall allows users to share their items (food, drinks) they want to sell at the parties. Food has its name, description and weight. The drink has its name and volume. Both drink and food have price and quantity.

Your task is to create a NodeJS API Application that fulfils the aforementioned criteria and assume the following requirements:
Requirements:

As an anonymous user you can:
login/register using username and password

As an authenticated user you can:
see one list of items of both types: food and drinks for all users
create a new item (both types)
remove item

Additional notes:
the application must be runnable in node.js 10+
structure your code as if it was a real, production application
commit as you go along and push to your GitHub
feel free to use any database, framework or library of your choice
Time
Estimated time to finish this task is 4 hours.
